        I would really rather not have a header above my nav section here. 
        Is that an option? I've included it for the sake of this assignment. 
        I wouldn't mind "Becky Roesch," smaller at the top left, and then my 
        nav links at the right. Please advise -->

        <p>I'm Becky Roesch, a teacher at heart and marketer by trade. My career spans classroom teaching, Apple retail training and customer education. In my current role, I'm a marketer. I help shape our customers' views with my background in education and training. I <b>create clear solutions</b> for complex problems and <b>provide proactive support</b> with creativity. My actions build relationships, and those relationships drive results.<br>I'm finishing my Masters in Information Science and Learning Technology at the University of Missouri Columbia this fall. I completed a Chancellor's Certificate in Electronic Arts & Publishing at the University of Missouri St. Louis. I earned my BS.Ed in Elementary Education (with an English minor) from Northwest Missouri State University.</p>
        <p>My favorite quote comes from cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead:</p>
    
        <blockquote>"Children must be taught <em>how</em> to think, not <em>what</em> to think."</blockquote>
    
        <p>I focus on meeting learners where they are and inspiring them to go farther. These twin philosophies guide my approach to learning and customer support. After graduating I’m considering a handful of directions I could take professionally, potentially including onboarding and educating clients for a technology firm.</p>
