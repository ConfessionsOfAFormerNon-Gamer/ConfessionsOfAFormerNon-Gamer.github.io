Hello! I'm Becky Roesch, completing my final semester in the IS_LT Masters program. It's been a long road, but I’m here now! In my current job as an e-commerce marketer, I sometimes get to dabble in HTML while building our emails, but I’m relatively inexperienced. In 1995 I built my first website using the WYSIWYG Netscape Communicator. My fifth graders snapped photos of our activities with an Apple QuickTake 150. They loved updating the site with our pictures and captions, and I loved keeping parents and admin informed! In this course, I want to learn to build clean, responsive pages with good accessibility. I hope to use my site as a springboard for my portfolio this fall. When not studying, I read and travel. Recent adventures include scuba diving, improv, and paddleboarding. I just returned from Costa Rica, and Uruguay awaits next summer to celebrate my degree! From building websites in the '90s to earning my Masters today, I'm excited to see where technology and curiosity take me next!
